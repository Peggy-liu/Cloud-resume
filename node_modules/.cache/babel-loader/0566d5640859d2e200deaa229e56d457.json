The correct format is as\n          following:{' '}\n        </p>\n        <pre>\n          graphqlOperation(updateVisitorCount,{' '}\n          {\"{input : { id: '1', count: num + 1 }}\"})\n        </pre>\n        <h2>PROCESS MY CV DYNAMICALLY</h2>\n        <p>\n          Instead of putting my CV content statically in html, I put my CV in\n          json file and format them in a organised way so that I could process\n          and render the content dynamically using JSX. This way if I wish to\n          update my CV content, I could do it directly in the json file without\n          worrying about HTML rendering of the content.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <h2>IMPLEMENT EMAIL NOTIFICATION FOR CONTACT</h2>\n        <p>\n          I have implemented a contact form in the 'Contact Me' page. When a\n          visitor fill out the form and hit submit, it will send a post request\n          to a RestAPI implemented using AWS APIGateway, which will subsequently\n          trigger a lambda function in the cloud. Inside the lambda function, it\n          will utilise AWS SES(Simple Email Service) to send a formatted email\n          to my personal email address. If the API respond is successful, it\n          will prompt a success message to the visitor with their name,\n          otherwise an error message will be prompted instead.\n        </p>\n        <img src={contact} alt='ses code segment'></img>\n        <img src={email} alt='email'></img>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default BlogArticle\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

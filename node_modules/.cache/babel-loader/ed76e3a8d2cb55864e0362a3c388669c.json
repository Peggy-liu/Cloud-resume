The reason behind this is because I\n          didn't comply to the contract given by the API. This is the wrong API\n          call made by react:\n        </p>\n        <pre>\n          graphqlOperation(updateVisitorCount, {\"{ id: '1', count: num + 1 }\"})\n        </pre>\n        <p>And this is what's specified in the schema: </p>\n        <pre>\n          updateVisitorCount(input: UpdateVisitorCountInput!, condition:\n          ModelvisitorCountConditionInput): visitorCount\n        </pre>\n        <pre>input UpdateVisitorCountInput {'{id: ID!  count: Int}'}</pre>\n        <p>\n          Comparing two statements above, you will notice that the input I\n          passed to the first wrong statement is incomplete-- you need to insert\n          the input as it is specified in the schema. The correct format is as\n          following:{' '}\n        </p>\n        <pre>\n          graphqlOperation(updateVisitorCount,{' '}\n          {\"{input : { id: '1', count: num + 1 }}\"})\n        </pre>\n        <h2>PROCESS MY CV DYNAMICALLY</h2>\n        <p>\n          Instead of putting my CV content statically in html, I put my CV in\n          json file and format them in a organised way so that I could process\n          and render the content dynamically using JSX. This way if I wish to\n          update my CV content, I could do it directly in the json file without\n          worrying about HTML rendering of the content.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <h2>IMPLEMENT EMAIL NOTIFICATION FOR CONTACT</h2>\n        <p>\n          I have implemented a contact form in the 'Contact Me' page. When a\n          visitor fill out the form and hit submit, it will send a post request\n          to a RestAPI implemented using AWS APIGateway, which will subsequently\n          trigger a lambda function in the cloud. Inside the lambda function, it\n          will utilise AWS SES(Simple Email Service) to send a formatted email\n          to my personal email address. If the API respond is successful, it\n          will prompt a success message to the visitor with their name,\n          otherwise an error message will be prompted instead.\n        </p>\n        <Photo src={contact} name='ses code segment' />\n        <Photo src={email} name='email' />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default BlogArticle\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}

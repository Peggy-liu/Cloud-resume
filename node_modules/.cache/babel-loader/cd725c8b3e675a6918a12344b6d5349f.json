And the back\n          end infrastructure is created using amplify, who under-the-hood is\n          using CloudFormation to create and manage the infrastructures. In\n          order to use AWS backend service in our front end, AWS provides us\n          with several libraries, and they are installed into our react project\n          using npm.\n        </p>\n        <Photo src={archi} name='amplify and react' />\n        <h2 id='workflow'>WORKFLOW USING AMPLIFY</h2>\n        <Photo\n          src={workflow}\n          name='amplify workflow'\n          credit='https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/teams/overview'\n        />\n        <p>\n          The AWS Amplify Console provides a Git-based workflow for building,\n          deploying, and hosting your Amplify web app — both the frontend and\n          backend — from source control. You can easily connect the git-based\n          repository of your choice to Amplify, and on each commit made to the\n          repository, a new build will be initiated in Amplify. For the\n          simplicity, I've only maintained two branches--main and dev, for my\n          project. You can build several application based on the branch you\n          connect to, and you can even connect to different backend to frontend\n          of your choice--for instance, connect your frontend on main branch to\n          a dev backend. Frontend and backend are maintained seperately in\n          Amplify which provides us with huge flexibility. To create a new\n          backend environment for a particular branch, use Amplify CLI.\n        </p>\n        <h2 id='visitor'>IMPLEMENT A VISITOR DASHBOARD</h2>\n        <p>\n          The visitor dashboard is implemented on the home page to record the\n          number of visitors. The visitor number is persisted in AWS DynamoDB-a\n          NoSQL database. Amplify makes it extremely intuitive and\n          straight-forward for us to implement and integrate the whole\n          technology stack. A GraphQL API is created, as well as a GraphQL\n          schema and a DynamoDB table. You only need to provide Amplify your\n          data schema, and all the API operations and database table will be\n          created automatically.\n        </p>\n        <span>Below is the data schema for the visitor dashboard.</span>\n        <Photo src={schema} name='schema pic' />\n        <p>\n          Visitor count will be fetched from database through the API when the\n          page begins to render. The value will then be updated locally and\n          remotely again through API, the new value will be rendered through the\n          updated local state value. All these operations are combined into one\n          asyncronous function and will only be invoked once on the first render\n          using 'useEffect' react hook.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          One of the problems I've encountered was that I kept getting invalid\n          response from the graphql API. The reason behind this is that I didn't\n          comply to the contract given by the API. This is the wrong API call:\n        </p>\n        <pre>\n          graphqlOperation(updateVisitorCount, {\"{ id: '1', count: num + 1 }\"})\n        </pre>\n        <p>And this is what's specified in the schema: </p>\n        <pre>\n          updateVisitorCount(input: UpdateVisitorCountInput!, condition:\n          ModelvisitorCountConditionInput): visitorCount\n        </pre>\n        <pre>input UpdateVisitorCountInput {'{id: ID!  count: Int}'}</pre>\n        <p>\n          Comparing two statements above, you will notice that the input I\n          passed to the first wrong statement is incomplete-- you need to insert\n          the input as it is specified in the schema. The correct format is as\n          the following:{' '}\n        </p>\n        <pre>\n          graphqlOperation(updateVisitorCount,{' '}\n          {\"{input : { id: '1', count: num + 1 }}\"})\n        </pre>\n        <h2 id='cv'>PROCESS MY CV DYNAMICALLY</h2>\n        <p>\n          Instead of putting my CV content statically in html, I put my CV in\n          json file and format them in a organised way so that I could process\n          and render the content dynamically using JSX. This way if I wish to\n          update my CV content in the future, I can add content directly to the json file without\n          worrying about HTML rendering of the content.{' '}\n        </p>\n        <h2 id='email'>IMPLEMENT EMAIL NOTIFICATION FOR CONTACT</h2>\n        <p>\n          I have implemented a contact form in the 'Contact Me' page. When a\n          visitor fill out the form and hit submit, it will send a post request\n          to a RestAPI implemented using AWS APIGateway, which will subsequently\n          trigger a lambda function in the cloud. Inside the lambda function, it\n          will utilise AWS SES(Simple Email Service) to send a formatted email\n          to my personal email address. If the API respond is successful, it\n          will prompt a success message to the visitor with their name,\n          otherwise an error message will be prompted instead.\n        </p>\n        <Photo src={contact} name='ses code segment' />\n        <Photo src={email} name='email' />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default BlogArticle\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
